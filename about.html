            <p>I graduated with a bachelors degree in Computer Science from Dalhousie University with a 3.97 GPA in 2023.
                I am also fluent in French, with a B2 certificate from the DELF program.
                Lastly, I graduated High School from the IB program in 2019 on the Principal's List (grade average of at least 90%).

            <p class="skills_sub">Skills</p>
            <p>I am fluent in a multitude of tools and languages. However, I excel at functionality based coding via Java, Python, C, Javascript, and VBA. That being said, I am also fluent in CSS, HTML, and MySQL.
                Outside of coding languages, I am competent in both Git and Linux.

            <p class="work_sub">Work Experience</p>
            <p>My most valuable work experience would have to be my first COOP placement working for Bell. *Fill out after finishing work term*.
                I have also developed customer service skills through my past experience working for Circle K. I worked at my local Circle K for over a year as a Customer Service Associate. In that time, I developed strong customer service skills and learned how to handle delicate/age-restricted goods.

        <div class="motivation">
            <p class="motivation_sub">Motivations</p>
            <p>My main motivations in computer science revolve around creating applications that make previously tedious tasks quick and easy. This is very clearly explored through my projects, as I often create calculators to speed up certain assignments. That being said, I am currently attempting to expand my knowledge regarding the design aspect of coding. It comes to me much less naturally so I plan on working heavily on improving myself.</p>
